# TeamN

## Who we are
TeamN is a group of dedicated students studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Calgary (Fall 2020).
Our aim is to become perceptive and insightful designers by studying the user experience and applying our findings
to our project's development.
### Stephane Dorotich
> I study a variety of topics but am currently completing my studies in Computer Science. I am interested in the ways we
use and abuse technology and would like to design tools that facilitate decision making and consensus building. I am an
avid musician, rock climber, and gamer, enjoying the mental and physical efforts of those activities.
