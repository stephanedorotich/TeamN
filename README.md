# TeamN

## Who We Are
TeamN is a group of dedicated students studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Calgary (Fall 2020).
Our aim is to become perceptive and insightful designers by studying the user experience and applying our findings
to our project's development.

## Team Portfolio
Our [team portfolio](https://teamlepinee.wixsite.com/cpsc481teamn) hosts the deliverables for
each completed stage of our project as well as bios for each of our team members.

## Team Contract
Our [team contract](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/teamContract_teamN.pdf) contains a short profile for each team member as well as a group drafted contract that outlines the code of conduct that our members will adhere to for the course of the project.

## Stage One
In Stage One, in addition to creating our Portfolio and establishing our Team Contract, we proposed 3 products that solve a problem or improve an existing solution. We proposed a Schedule Planner to aid users with time management, a Virtual Clothing App to allow users to 'try-on' clothing while shopping online, and a Drone Delivery Command Centre Interface to manage a fleet of drones performing local deliveries.

Our detailed project proposals can be found [here](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/projectProposal_teamN.pdf).
