# TeamN

## Who we are
TeamN is a group of dedicated students studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Calgary (Fall 2020).
Our aim is to become perceptive and insightful designers by studying the user experience and applying our findings
to our project's development.
### Stephane Dorotich
 ### Roles: Coordinator, Editor 
> I study a variety of topics but am currently completing my studies in Computer Science. I am interested in the ways we
use and abuse technology and would like to design tools that facilitate decision making and consensus building. I am an
avid musician, rock climber, and gamer, enjoying the mental and physical efforts of those activities.
### Kathryn Lepine
 ### Roles: UI developer  
> Kathryn Lepine is in her fourth year at the University of Calgary studying a combined degree of Computer Science and Finance. Her skills include organization and problem solving and she hopes to pursue a career in Information Technology in the future. In her free time, she enjoys hiking in the mountains, playing tennis, curling, and running. This summer, she hiked 227 kilometers and 22,005 meters in elevation. She is a hard-working individual who values the balance between academics and physical activity in her free time. 
### Andy Ma
 ### Roles: Reviewer 
>  Hi, my name is Andy Ma. I am a fifth-year student at the University of Calgary. My program of study is a combined Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and General Mathematics. In my studies in Computer Science, I have chosen to take courses in a wide variety of fields in Computer Science, including Information Security, Computer Graphics, Human-Computer Interaction, Software Engineering, Theoretical Computer Science, and Computer Networks. As a result, I have a relatively high breadth of knowledge. I have also developed a proficiency in many programming languages, including Python, Java, C, C++, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP/SQL. From my studies in General Mathematics, I developed strong logical reasoning skills and the ability to solve difficult problems. My academic performance at the University of Calgary demonstrates that I am a fast learner who consistently produces high-quality work in a timely manner. 
### Macks Tam
 ### Roles: Writer, UI developer, Note Scribe 
 >  Mackenzie (Macks) Tam is a third year Computer Science Major at the University of Calgary. His skills include teamwork, critical thinking, and a desire to learn. He worked as a Swim Instructor for the City of Calgary for over 5 years teaching all ages how to swim. He spends his off time running, doing martial arts, and playing guitar. When he doesn’t understand a subject, he spends time learning about it until he has enough knowledge to proceed with the task. Overall, Macks is a friendly, dedicated hard worker who is always looking to learn new skills. 
### Nicholas Wasilewski
 ### Roles: UX developer, Program Architect 
>  My name is Nicholas Wasilewski and I am in my 4th year of a Computer Science degree at the University of Calgary. I am proficient in programming in many languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, Haskell and Prolog. I have strong skills in communication, teamwork and organization. Most of my hobbies are related to technology.  In my spare time, I like learning about cutting-edge technology, playing computer games and building computers. I also really enjoy outdoor activities such as camping, off-roading and golf.   

## Project Proposals
### Project 1:
Automatic Day Planner  

Description:  

  As a University Student (Pre-COVID-19) managing a full course load, a job and a social life, planning one’s schedule can be extremely tedious and very difficult. Organization is something many people struggle with, not just students, but anyone with a busy schedule. Many people attempt to organize their schedules and end up giving up due to the hassle. We wish to design an app/desktop app that automatically plans out your days. This will allow those who struggle with allocating time for everything, or those that just put minimal effort into planning their days, a fast and efficient way of doing so. You will be able to enter in your preferences such as: How long you eat lunch, if you prefer to work in the evening or morning, how long you can stay focused on a task, etc. Once it has all your preferences it creates a schedule with your to-do list for the day, weeks, or months. This schedule will be based off all the user’s inputted preferences to allow for maximum comfort while adhering to it. You can even put in specific tasks’ due dates and how long you believe it will take. The application will allocate time in your schedule before the due date so you can finish the task. With this, those that really struggle with organization or planning might be able to find more success in their jobs, school or just with being more organized. So, making “be more organized” your new year's resolution might not be a bad idea.  

### Project 2:
Virtual Clothing App  

Description:  

  The 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic has swept the globe, forcing societies to drastically alter their way of living. One predominant change that has yielded from this pandemic is the sheer magnitude of online shopping. Online shopping serves customers many benefits such as the convenience of not having to leave their homes and the ability to filter through thousands of items in seconds. However, with these benefits come with weaknesses; one major downfall of online shopping is that customers are not able to try on merchandise before they buy them. This means that shoppers are not able to know for certain if a piece of attire will fit them properly. Specifically relating to clothes, buying attire that does not fit may lower a customer’s self-image leading them to feel insecure, unworthy, and inadequate. We are developing an app that will allows users to virtually try on clothes when shopping online. The users will start by submitting multiple photos of themselves from different angles. Next, our artificial intelligence will analyze the photos and create a virtual representation of the user. The user will then be able to shop at various online stores and virtually try on clothes through the app. This will allow the customers to have an accurate representation of how the clothes will look on their body type before they purchase them. We know that all customers have different body types and all clothes fit differently. That is why it is our mission to give users a virtual representation of their potential purchases before they buy them.    

### Project 3:
Drone Delivery App  

Description:  

  Since the covid-19 pandemic, the food and small package delivery service has skyrocketed. Understandably, people want their food delivered quickly so it stays warm and fresh. They also want their packages immediately and the quickest way to get anything delivered is by drones. With a fleet of drones making all deliveries, wait times would be a fraction of what they are now. This new drone delivery service will run on a mobile app, that would provide real time tracking of the package and your location. The accuracy of the arrival time will be greatly improved because flying drones don’t face many obstacles. (Except approval from transport Canada)
