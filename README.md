# TeamN

## Who We Are
TeamN is a group of dedicated students studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Calgary (Fall 2020).
Our aim is to become perceptive and insightful designers by studying the user experience and applying our findings
to project development.

## Stage One
For stage one we:
- Created a [repository](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN)
- Created a [portfolio](https://teamlepinee.wixsite.com/cpsc481teamn)
- Drafted a [team contract](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/teamContract_teamN.pdf)
- Submitted a [PDF](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/projectProposal_teamN.pdf) with three project proposals.
