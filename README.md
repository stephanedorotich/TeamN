# TeamN

## Who We Are
TeamN is a group of dedicated students studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Calgary (Fall 2020).
Our aim is to become perceptive and insightful designers by studying the user experience and applying our findings
to our project's development.

## Team Portfolio
Our [team portfolio](https://teamlepinee.wixsite.com/cpsc381teamn) hosts the deliverables for
each completed stage of our project as well as bios for each of our team members.

## Team Contract
Our [team contract](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/teamContract_teamN.pdf) contains a short profile on each team member as well a group drafted contract
outlining the code that our members will adhere to for the course of the project.

## Stage One
In Stage One we were tasked with proposing 3 different projects. The requisite is to develop a product or a service
that solves a problem or improves upon an existing solutions. We proposed a Schedule Planner to find time for all the
important things, a Virtual Clothing App to allow users to 'try-on' clothing while shopping online, and a Drone Delivery
Command Centre Interface to allow for the management of a fleet of drones performing small-sized local deliveries.

Our full project proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/projectProposal_teamN.pdf).
