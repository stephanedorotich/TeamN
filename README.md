# Team N

## Who We Are
Team N is a group of dedicated students studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Calgary (Fall 2020).
Our aim is to become perceptive and insightful designers by studying the user experience and applying our findings
to project development.

## Stage One
For stage one we:
- Created a [repository](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN)
- Created a [portfolio](https://teamlepinee.wixsite.com/cpsc481teamn)
- Drafted a [team contract](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/teamContract_teamN.pdf)
- Drafted a [PDF](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_one/stage_one/deliverables/projectProposal_teamN.pdf) with three project proposals

We proposed a *Schedule Planner* to facilitate time management, a *Virtual Clothing App* that allows users to 'try-on' clothing while shopping online, and a *Drone Delivery Command Centre Interface* to manage a fleet of drones performing local deliveries.

## Stage Two
For stage two we:
  - Conducted user research
  - Drafted a [user research report](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/stage_two/stage_two/deliverables/userResearchReport_TeamN.pdf)
  
We began by identifying our stakeholders, describing the people and users who are affected by our system. We then selected three IDEO methods we thought were appropriate to understanding our users and applied each. Our findings are summarized in our User Research Report. Reflecting on the research, we also describe 6-8 user tasks that our system could support.
