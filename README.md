### Stephane Dorotich
> I study a variety of topics but am currently completing my studies in Computer Science. I am interested in the ways we use and abuse technology and would like to design tools that facilitate decision making and consensus building. I am an avid musician, rock climber, and gamer, enjoying the mental and physical efforts of those activities.
