# Team N

## Who We Are
Team N is a group of dedicated students studying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the University of Calgary (Fall 2020).
Our aim is to become perceptive and insightful designers by studying the user experience and applying our findings
to project development.

Our members are:
- Stéphane Dorotich
- Kathryn Lepine
- Andy Ma
- Macks Tam
- Nicholas Wasilewski

## Stage One
<details>
   
For stage one we:
- Created a [repository](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN)
- Created a [portfolio](https://teamlepinee.wixsite.com/cpsc481teamn)
- Drafted a [team contract](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/master/stage_one/teamContract.pdf)
- Drafted a [PDF](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/master/stage_one/projectProposal.pdf) with three project proposals

We proposed a *Schedule Planner* to facilitate time management, a *Virtual Clothing App* that allows users to 'try-on' clothing while shopping online, and a *Drone Delivery Command Centre Interface* to manage a fleet of drones performing local deliveries.

## Stage Two
<details>

For stage two we:
  - Conducted user research
  - Drafted a [user research report](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/master/stage_two/userResearchReport.pdf)
  
We began by identifying our stakeholders, describing the people and users who are affected by our system. We then selected three IDEO methods we thought were appropriate to understanding our users and applied each. The methods we used were Activity Analysis, Error Analysis, and Scenarios and our findings are summarized in our User Research Report. Reflecting on the research, we also describe 6-8 user tasks that our system could support.

<details>

#### Kathryn Lepine:
- Participate in brainstorming for each IDEO method
- Report on the Activity Analysis method
- Update the [team portfolio](https://teamlepinee.wixsite.com/cpsc481teamn)

## Stage Three
<details>

For stage three we:
  - Brainstormed ideas for our system design by creating sketches
  - Created an affinity diagram
  - Reviewed those ideas and developed a unified concept for our system design
  - Created a storyboard
  - Built a low-fidelity [prototype](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/master/stage_three/DFMS_LowFi.pdf) of our system design (using Balsamiq)
  - Evaluated the prototype by performing Cognitive Walkthrough Analyses
  - Recorded a prototype demo video
  - Prepared a [presentation](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/master/stage_three/stageThreePresentation.pptx) to report and reflect on the stage
  - Wrote a [stage report](https://github.com/stephanedorotich/TeamN/blob/master/stage_three/stageThreeReport.pdf)
  
<details>
   <summary>Stage Three Tasks</summary>
   
Each team member participated in the following tasks:
- Draw 5 sketches based on the user tasks identified in stage two
